# Go-Link-Shortener

This project is a simple bitly clone that shortens URLs. The backend is written in go and the frontend in HTMX.

This is still a WIP, below is the features that will be implemented in the future:
* User account creation/authentication
* Link statistics for signed in users (Will need to figure out how to store on the backend)
* QR code images for links
